# Drug Product Database Automation

As a feasibility test, this project was meant for me to experiment with the DPD API in order to automate manual daily tasks.

The purpose of the script is as follows:
Given a list of Drug Identification Numbers (DINS) in an Excel file, extract the Company, Product Name, Status, and Schedule of the Drug from the DPD API, and present that information as a table in the same Excel file.

Originally using the Health Canada API, the API was not maintained, as such the switch to the DPD API was made.
